    <p><ul><li>The Mona Lisa is the world-renowned, half-length portrait painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci, created between 
        1503 and 1519. Housed at the Louvre Museum in Paris, the painting is likely of Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of a Florentine merchant.</li><br>

<li>Known for its subject's enigmatic smile and innovative sfumato technique, the painting gained global fame after a dramatic theft in 1911 and remains protected behind bulletproof glass.

    <ul><li>Botticelli's painting illustrates the myth of the birth of Aphrodite. The beautiful goddess drifts to the shore in a sea shell, 
        driven by the Zephyr's wind (West wind), and on the shore she is met by one of the Graces. <br>
        <li>The Birth of Venus is well preserved thanks to the fact that Botticelli applied a protective layer of egg yolk to the painting. 
         This masterpiece is kept in Florence in the Uffizi Gallery.

<p align="center"><ul><li>Contemporary art encompasses artworks created from the late 20th century to the present day, generally after the Modern
     Art movement. It is distinguished by its emphasis on challenging artistic traditions, a wide variety of experimental mediums, and its connection 
     to current societal and personal themes like identity, politics, and globalization. </li><br><li>Unlike modern art's focus on specific stylistic movements, 
     contemporary art is eclectic, diverse, and lacks a single organizing principle, reflecting the dynamic and evolving nature of today's world.
